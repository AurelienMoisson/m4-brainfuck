## macros

In the directory 'macros', you will find a lot of macros used to make writing brainfuck slightly easier.

## memory use

The memory is divided into chunks of varying sizes.
Each chunk is arranged as such :

```
empty_space[4]   chunk_address[3]   chunk_type[1]   chunk_content[...]
```

### chunk_address

A chunk_address is guaranteed to be unique.
They are also consecutive.

### chunk_type

0. A chunk_type of 0 means the memory is not allocated yet. It also means there is no allocated chunk following this.
1. A chunk_type of 1 means the following chunk is a 0-terminated string. The 0 terminator is considered part of the chunk_content.

There may be more chunk_types added in the future
